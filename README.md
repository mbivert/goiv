    goiv(1)                     General Commands Manual                    goiv(1)
    
    NAME
           goiv â€” go image viewer 1.0
    
    SYNOPSIS
           goiv [-h]
           goiv [-r] path [paths ...]
    
    DESCRIPTION
           goiv  sequentially displays images from some paths, scanned recursively
           when relevant. The final list of images is eventually shuffled.
    
           The GUI is sharp, and relies on a a bunch of (undocumented) shortcuts.
